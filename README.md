<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Overview

`wakeflow` is a Python package primarily for calculating tidally-induced perturbations resulting from a planet embedded in a gas disk. It is an implementation of both the linear theory for planet wake generation ([Goldreich and Tremaine 1979](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979ApJ...233..857G)) and the non-linear theory of wake propagation ([Rafikov 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...569..997R/abstract)) in 2D. `wakeflow` lets you generate these models by specifying disk and system properties as typically parameterised in the planet formation literature. It also contains additional tools allowing you to:
* Visualise your results
* Create 3D models under some assumptions
* Interface directly with the radiative transfer code [`MCFOST`](https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost) to generate synthetic images of these models
* (Planned) Rotate and project your models to create line-of-sight maps of velocity perturbations at some emitting layer
* (Planned) Create analytic predictions for peak velocity maps as found in [Calcino et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929L..25C/abstract)


`wakeflow` is intended to allow both theorists and observers to easily generate models of the interaction between disks and embedded planets, instead of having to run expensive fluid simulations. In particular, `wakeflow` allows researchers to easily test whether a planet can explain kinematic perturbations observed in some set of disk observations, so-called _velocity kinks_ (see for example [Pinte et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860L..13P/abstract)). `wakeflow` therefore also allows for a fast exploration of disk and planet parameters in order to determine those most likely to recreate observations, before resources are spent on 3D simulations. In addition, `wakeflow` models may be used with [`MCFOST`](https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost) to create synthetic images that may be compared directly with observations.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

`wakeflow` may be most easily installed from the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wakeflow/)), or can also be installed from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomHilder/wakeflow) if you wish to make contributions. Dependencies for `wakeflow` consist mostly of standard python libraries. We recommend using a package manager such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to make your life easier, but this is not required.




### PyPI (pip)

The easiest way to install `wakeflow` is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wakeflow/), using `pip`:
```sh
pip install wakeflow
```
that's it!



### From source (GitHub)

If you want to contribute to, or modify `wakeflow`, you should install it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomHilder/wakeflow). After installing the dependencies (see below), simply fork the repo using the button in the top right, and then clone it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<replace-by-your-username>/wakeflow.git
```
Alternatively, you may install from source even if you do not wish to edit `wakeflow`, in which case I would recommend skipping the fork and simply cloning the repo directly:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TomHilder/wakeflow.git
```
Navigate to the directory it is installed in:
```sh
cd wakeflow
```
You can verify that you are in the correct directory by checking that you see `README.md` when you run:
```sh
ls
```
Now we use `pip` to create a local and _editable_ install of `wakeflow`:
```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```
Do not forget the dot (.) in the above command, as it tells `pip` to look in the current working directory (where `wakeflow` is). The advantage of installing this way is that it places a _link_ to `wakeflow` in your `site-packages` folder instead of _moving_ it there. Now when you edit the code in `wakeflow/src/wakeflow/` it will edit your installation!

### Dependencies

Python packages:

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `astropy`
* `scipy`
* `setuptools`
* `pyyaml`
* `tqdm`
* `pytest` (optional)
* `pytest-cov` (optional)
* [`pymcfost`](https://github.com/cpinte/pymcfost) (optional, only if interfacing with [MCFOST](https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost))

If you install `wakeflow` using `pip` then the required dependencies will be automatically installed.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Please refer to the [Quickstart tutorial](https://wakeflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/quickstart.html) for the most typical usage of `wakeflow` including generating models and reading the results. Additional examples of more advanced usage can be found in the [Documentation](https://wakeflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Testing

`wakeflow` is automatically unit-tested on Github using Actions and [`tox`](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox). If you have installed `wakeflow` from source, you may run a local test on your machine provided that you have `pytest` and `pytest-cov` installed. Simply navigate to your installation directory and run:
```sh
pytest
```


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions to `wakeflow` are welcome. If you would like to implement a new feature, please:

1. Install using the above installation from source instructions
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Added some NewFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/NewFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

If you have a suggestion that would improve `wakeflow` but do not have the time or means to implement it yourself, please simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement". If you would like to report a bug, please open an issue with the tag "bug".

Don't forget to give the project a star!
